Using unsupervised algorithms in Machine Learning to help us explore data when we’re not sure what we’re looking for.

#### Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies

The goal is of this project is to analyze a dataset of cryptocurrencies in any way that would discover trends that could help
convince stakeholders to invest in these new cryptocurrencies, at affordable prices.

Utilizing the unsupervised algorithm allows us to explore data without any known output, we only use input data.
The algorithm helps us discover patterns or groups. First, we process the data for an unsupervised model, 
then we use the clustering and K-means algorithm, and finally we make our model more efficient by using principle component analysis.
